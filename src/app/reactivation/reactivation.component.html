  <p>In the filtration process, contaminated liquid or gas is infused through a substrate of active carbon and is purged out the other side of the substrate. Used active carbon is loaded with pollutants and must be replaced. When you dispose it, it should be treated as environmentally harmful waste.</p>
  <p>The best and the most cost-effective method for treating used active carbon is recycling, a process called reactivation. The process of reactivation removes pollutants from the active carbon after which it can be reused. Active carbon reactivation process is carried out in a furnace, at a temperature of 1000oC, which eliminates all the pollutants. The process renews the adsorption capacity of the active carbon. In general, the parameters of the new and reactivated carbon are similar. In addition, the reactivation process may also be adjusted to achieve certain specifications in the activated carbon according to customer requirement. The active carbon provided to Reactive for recycling undergoes the reactivation process and within a few days is returned to the customer as active as ever.</p>
